# CITS5206-Capstone

# Project Overview
eWMS (Electronic Working Method Statement) is a web-based system designed to assist administrators, supervisors, and engineers in managing locomotive installation and commissioning tasks efficiently.

This system digitalizes traditional Working Method Statements (WMS) by leveraging modern mobile and web technologies. It enables document import, task assignment, progress tracking, and offline support to streamline daily engineering workflows.

# Key Features
1.  **Role-Based Access Control**: Users (Administrators, Supervisors, Engineers) have personalized dashboards and access rights.
2.  **WMS Document Importing**: Supports bulk import of Microsoft Word and Excel files as WMS templates.
3.  **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can interact with the same WMS simultaneously, including adding text, images, and videos.
4.  **Offline Support**: Engineers can work without an internet connection, and data syncs when online.
5.  **Locomotive Baseline Management**: Tracks installation progress, reports updates, and manages system configurations.
